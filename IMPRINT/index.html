      <h3>Liability for content</h3>
      The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot assume any liability for
      the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our
      own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 (1) DDG and general legislation. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG,
      however, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
      investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in
      accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible
      from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as we become aware of such infringements, we will
      remove this content immediately.

      <h3>Liability for links</h3>
      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we
      cannot accept any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is
      always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
      violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent
      monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If
      we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

      <h3>Copyright</h3>
      The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
      Duplication, processing, distribution and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the
      copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of
      this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created
      by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified
      as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we
      become aware of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

      <h3>Data privacy</h3>
      The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name,
      address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our website, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as
      possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
      We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may be
      subject to security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
      We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third
      parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information material. The operators of the website expressly
      reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as
      spam e-mails.
